# Create Usagi input files per type
## Numeric fields
A field_id, field name, unit name, category, note and use item_count as frequency.

Both prio fields and non-prio fields are included. 
The priority fields have an added 1_000_000 to their count.

```{sql, connection=conn, output.var = "df_numeric_all"}
SELECT 
  fields.field_id as field_id, 
  fields.title as field_name, 
  fields.units as unit_name,
  categories.title as category_name,
  fields.item_count as item_count,
  CASE WHEN prio_fields.field_id IS NOT NULL
       THEN fields.item_count + 1000000
       ELSE fields.item_count
  END as priority,
  fields.notes as notes
FROM fields
LEFT JOIN prio_fields ON fields.field_id = prio_fields.field_id
LEFT JOIN categories ON fields.category_id = categories.category_id
WHERE fields.value_type_id IN (11, 31) -- Integer or Continous
ORDER BY fields.field_id
;
```

```{R}
write.csv(df_numeric_all, 'numeric_fields.csv', row.names = FALSE, na = '')
write.csv(df_numeric_all[df_numeric_all$priority != df_numeric_all$item_count,], 'numeric_prio_fields.csv', row.names = FALSE, na = '')
```


## Discrete fields
A field_id, field name, value code, value name, category, note and item_count.

### Discrete boolean
```{sql, connection=conn, output.var = "df_discrete_boolean"}
SELECT
  fields.field_id as field_id, 
  fields.title as field_name, 
  encvalues.value as value_code,
  encvalues.meaning as value_name,
  categories.title as category_name,
  fields.item_count as item_count,
  fields.notes as notes
FROM prio_fields AS fields
LEFT JOIN categories ON fields.category_id = categories.category_id
LEFT JOIN  encvalues ON fields.encoding_id = encvalues.encoding_id
WHERE fields.value_type_id IN (21, 22) -- Single categorical or Multiple categorical
 AND fields.encoding_id IN (1,7,21,27,29,227,502,503,508,514,520,634,1021,1022,8708,100008,100009,100010,100264,100267,100273,100280,100345,100349,100352,100416,100563,100564,100579,100599,100617,100631,100640,100668) -- All encodings with Yes/No
 AND (encvalues.selectable ISNULL OR encvalues.selectable = 1) 
ORDER BY fields.field_id, encvalues.value
;
```

```{R}
write.csv(df_discrete_boolean, 'discrete_boolean_prio_fields.csv', row.names = FALSE, na = '')
```

### Discrete with large code lists
Do not output the code lists known in OMOP (ICD10, ICD9, OPCS4).

For the remaining fields, split out the large code lists with diagnostic and operative codes.
```{sql, connection=conn, output.var = "df_discrete"}
SELECT 
  fields.field_id as field_id, 
  fields.title as field_name, 
  encvalues.value as value_code,

  fields.item_count as item_count,
  fields.notes as notes
FROM prio_fields AS fields
LEFT JOIN categories ON fields.category_id = categories.category_id
LEFT JOIN  encvalues ON fields.encoding_id = encvalues.encoding_id
WHERE fields.value_type_id IN (21, 22) -- Single categorical or Multiple categorical
  AND fields.encoding_id NOT IN (19, 87, 240) -- ICD10, ICD9, OPCS4 (note, OPCS3 is not OMOPed yet)
